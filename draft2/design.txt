Draft 2: The Migraines
Devin Lewis, Ariana Borlak, Charlie Roslansky

Abstract
Our company is Zereaux Day, a simple calendar app with a login page that allows for 
password reset, which is vulnerable to email parameter pollution. The log file is 
accessible to an authenticated account and executes any PHP code. The server also runs 
on an outdated Linux kernel version, which is vulnerable to DirtyPipe.


Step-by-step walkthrough
1. Reset password and intercept with Burpsuite to change where the reset link is sent
	What you get: account login
2. Use Burpsuite to inject PHP code into the log file and navigate to it to execute the 
   code
	What you get: a reverse shell as www-data
3. (Potential step if we have time to implement) Find a file containing hashed passwords 
   and crack them
	What you get: A user with write-permissions
4. Clone and run the Dirty Pipe exploit (if you are crazy, write an exploit yourself)
	What you get: root login

Current implementation status:
	At the moment, we have a barebones web server that lets anyone do log poisoning (the 
current log file is a .php - we should probably figure out how to execute PHP code in 
arbitrary files). We also have the 5.15.5 Linux kernel installed on Ubuntu, allowing for 
the Dirty Pipe exploit.
	We have started working on sending reset emails but are still debugging. We do not 
yet have password-protected pages or functionality to reset passwords, but have done 
some trial and error with it so far.

Deep-dive topics:
- Dirty Pipe: we will all try to understand it to whatever degree we can, but it is 
	complicated
- Email servers/parameter pollution: Ariana
- Log files/Log poisoning: Devin
- Authentication (Apache modules and built from scratch): Charlie
